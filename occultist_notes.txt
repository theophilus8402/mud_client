Hunting and combat both will center around Occultism and is your primary
skill for the future. Tarot and Domination are utility and
Combat. Early skills in Tarot potentially worth getting are Fool and
Priestess. Trait suggestion is Quick Witted, focusing on Intelligence
path.

You have two main kill routes to choose from, enlighten and truename.

To achieve enlighten, you will need to instill + bloodleech until you
stick 3 physical affs and then stick cadmus. Once you have cadmus, moon
(targetted or untargetted + devil) and either storm or humbug or
bloodleech until 5 affs are stacked. Stick hecate and madness, then add
more moons with storm or humbug until there are enough mental affs to
enlighten and unravel.

Truename uses enervate + hound to pressure health and mana together to
attempt to get them down to 40% mana. Hit with cleansaura and use
abomination to harvest truenames. You can harvest up to 3 truenames via
this mechanic which is usually enough to kill someone. Truename will do
40-50% damage and give aeon thru speed. The aeon makes it hard for your
target to escape, potentially allowing you to hit with all three and
secure the kill. Using tents will increase your chances of hindering
them long enough. The mind warden trait is useful for this path.
