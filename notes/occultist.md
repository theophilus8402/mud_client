Hunting and combat both will center around Occultism and is your primary
skill for the future. Tarot and Domination are utility and
Combat. Early skills in Tarot potentially worth getting are Fool and
Priestess. Trait suggestion is Quick Witted, focusing on Intelligence
path.

You have two main kill routes to choose from, enlighten and truename.

To achieve enlighten, you will need to instill + bloodleech until you
stick 3 physical affs and then stick cadmus. Once you have cadmus, moon
(targetted or untargetted + devil) and either storm or humbug or
bloodleech until 5 affs are stacked. Stick hecate and madness, then add
more moons with storm or humbug until there are enough mental affs to
enlighten and unravel.

Truename uses enervate + hound to pressure health and mana together to
attempt to get them down to 40% mana. Hit with cleansaura and use
abomination to harvest truenames. You can harvest up to 3 truenames via
this mechanic which is usually enough to kill someone. Truename will do
40-50% damage and give aeon thru speed. The aeon makes it hard for your
target to escape, potentially allowing you to hit with all three and
secure the kill. Using tents will increase your chances of hindering
them long enough. The mind warden trait is useful for this path.


-- talk with dalran about city defense and raiding
- it doesn't take a set number of kills to make a raid sanctioned,
    it's the people and their rank that matters
- you don't lose xp while defending, but you do while attacking
- attackers gain xp if a tank goes off in the city
- target calling in a party:
(Party): Dalran says, "TARGET Knight."
(Party): Dalran says, "Although in smaller groups it's useful to have the ability to announce who you are targetting."
(Party): Dalran says, "Maybe make a function to announce stuff so you can use one toggle for all announces."
(Party): Dalran says, "It's what I do so if I end up 1v1ing in a party I don't have to spam everyone else."
big roles will be aeon and hinder
    - tentacles - based of enemy list, so make sure it's up-to-date
(Party): Dalran says, "Tower is useful when the enemy group is rushing you to attempt to split them up."
(Party): Dalran says, "It's really underrated by a lot of people but def good."
(Party): Dalran says, "Hangedman is super potent and if you're not aeoning and the group has enough damage thats likely what you'll be spamming the most."
4rty): Dalran says, "Tower is something referred to generally as room prep."
(Party): Dalran says, "No need to waste a balance on it during a fight, when you can do it before hand."
(Party): You say, "But, I shouldn't just throw a tower whenever a fight starts?"
    - aeon is one of the best things to do in a fight
    - chaos storm - vertigo is good in a fight to keep guys from flying away
    - physical/mental affs are so/so
        - mental is good with:
            - depthswalker to drain mana (focus) because they have an instakill
            - bards do more dmg when target has more mental affs
- defense
    - orb when taking a lot of hits, makes a big difference
    - heartstone/simulacrum
    - distortaura
    - priestess/fool
        - can do for others too
- running away
    - have universe down before a fight, means I can just touch it
    - hermit/istria
        - istria will disappear after you die
        - stopped by monolith (universe is not)
- bombs
    - concussion - most used, stuns, disrupts blocking
    - web - webs
    - dust - blackout
    - butterfly - brings peeps down from the skies
    - can't go through shields
- peeps who can beckon
    - priests, waterlords, depthswalkers, magi
- line of site strats
    - LoS
    - aeon + doppie
    - lust / empress needs
        - blackout (monk, dustbomb)
        - two occies
    - star stack
    - other peeps can:
        - snipe
        - breathstream (dragons) - can go break shield
- suicide strats
    - orb before starting
    - chaosrays as much as possible
    - do as much aoe dmg as possible without worrying about friendly fire
- lust allies
    - be mutually allied to empress from longer distances
