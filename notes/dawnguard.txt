----- CLHELP STUDENTS ----

Steps listed with a * after the number are only required for members of
The Dawnblade.

STUDENTS
========

1*. Obtain a Dawnblade mentor.

7. Review CLHELP COMBATBASICS and learn the required contents.
Discussing the concepts with a Dawnblade member who understands your
class is highly recommended, as the answers are not contained within the
scroll - merely the questions you should learn the answers to.

9. Review CLHELP RANGED, CLHELP AFFLICTIONS, CLHELP SURVIVAL, and CLHELP
TRAPSANDOTHER and be familar with their contents.

10. Review CLHELP BASICSKILLS and CLHELP GROUPCOMBATBASICS and learn the
minimum required skills.

12. Pass an interview with a Dawnblade Master on the concepts in the
scrolls.

Upon passing this interview, a student will be assigned the position of
Advanced Student in the Dawnguard. This serves as one of the
requirements for Dawnblades to graduate to House Rank 2 (Aspirant).



ADVANCED STUDENTS
=================

13. Obtain level 70.

14. Read CLHELP <yourclass>G and understand the contents, and begin an
initial read of CLHELP <yourclass>. CLHELP <yourclass> teaches you more
about your class and its various kill paths. You will need to use one of
these kill paths in the future steps as an Advanced Student.

15. Learn how to chart a kill path for your class, based on the concept
and method detailed in CLHELP CHARTS. This process will allow you to
gain a greater understanding of the underlying principles of combat, and
learn how to execute a proper offense. This chart should be recorded in
a letter, ready to be shown to a Dawnblade Master in the next step.

16. Demonstrate to a Dawnblade Master the ability to follow target calls
in a party and attack the called target appropriately, as well as a
ranged attack of the sort that would be useful in group combat (for
example: archery or throwing bombs).

17. Perform a demonstration of what you have learned on a Dawnblade
Master. You are expected to do what you can with what abilities you
have, and demonstrate the kill path charted in the previous step. If you
are tri-transed, you are expected to slay the Master, while he or she is
not fighting back. If the Master is particularly difficult to slay, the
Master may deem your prowess sufficient to pass without slaying him or
her.

Upon passing this demonstration, an Advanced Student will be promoted to
the rank of Dawnguard, and will have completed their formal training
within the Institute. This serves as one of the requirements for
Dawnblades to graduate to House Rank 3 (Oathsworn). Dawnguards are
welcomed to remain in the Institute, so they may share their experience
and assist new students, as well as continue their own training.

NOTE: Students with notably advanced combat skills may, at the
discretion of the Guardian of the Blades or the Argent Hand, be allowed
to immediately perform a combat demonstration (as per the final step,
detailed above). If this demonstration is successful, such exceptional
students will be immediately promoted to the rank of Dawnguard.














We are a military House, and as such, it is expected that you know your
Officers, and that you get to know them and work with them. To reach
this end, you will read HOUSE STRUCTURE to find each of the Officers of
the House and send them a short message introducing yourself. When
speaking on House channels, you will be expected to refer to each
officer by their title, and to speak respectfully to them at all times,
in and out of public settings.

Below are the requirements which must be fulfilled in order to be
promoted to Aspirant:

1- Attain the rank of Alumni in The Targossian Academy. In the Academy,
you will learn how to live as an Adventurer in Targossas, and prepare
yourself to swear your Oath to the Dawnspear. See CLHELP TTA to learn
more about the Academy and CLHELP AWELCOME within the Academy clan to
learn how to become an Alumni.

4- Attain the position of Advanced Student in the Dawnguard Institute.
As an Advanced Student, you will have demonstrated an understanding of
combat theory, and be ready to put that knowledge to use in defense of
Creation. See CLHELP STUDENTS in the Dawnguard clan for more
information.

5- Read HHELP MASTERY, HHELP EXCELLENCE, and HHELP HEROISM. These
scrolls delve into the ideals which guide our every actions as
Dawnblades. You will be expected to understand and embrace them before
you may advance to Aspirant.

6- Learn about the House Estates, Estate Security, and the locations
within the Estate itself. Understand the importance of not idling in the
estate, and the interaction of our resident denizens and their tasks and
duties within the House. Please refer to HHELP ESTATESECURITY.


Upon the completion of these tasks, you will be promoted to the House
Rank of Aspirant. See HHELP ASPIRANT for more information on how to
progress further within the House.

Upon completion of any task, inform an Officer of the House (HOUSE
STRUCTURE) so that they may make a record of it in the House logs. Aides
of the Argent Hand should then update HHELP PROGRESS.

CLHELP STUDENTS


Below are the steps which comprise the Dawnguard combat training
curriculum. These must be completed by all who have joined The

therefore not mandatory.

Discussing the concepts with a Dawnblade member who understands your
class is highly recommended, as the answers are not contained within the

assist you, as well as anyone listed on HOUSE STRUCTURE DAWNBLADE as an
Argent Champion, Commander, Drillmaster, or Guardian of the Blades.

12. Pass an interview with a Dawnblade Master on the concepts in the
