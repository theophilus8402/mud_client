                   Dismantle cooldown: 1.00 seconds of equilibrium

Cooldown:          Equilibrium
Details:
The creation of crystalline constructs is a closely guarded secret of
those that practice Artifice. With this knowledge, you are able to
create golems from refined crystals to serve you.

Using the golem as a focus, you are able to perform spells that would
otherwise be impossible. Most spells performed in this way require a
certain crystal to be part of the golem (these are noted in the relevant
ability files). However, be warned. The larger your golem, the more its
presence shall interfere with your crystalline vibrations, with
potentially disastrous results. The pragmatic sorcerer shall endeavour
to balance both his golem's size with the number of vibrations he or she
has active at any one time.
