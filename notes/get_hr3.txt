HHELP VOLUNTEER

======== Assistance ========

--IMPORTANT--
A tome in the briefing hall of the Silver Citadel can guide you through
almost anything you will need to know on the path to Shieldwarden. It is
called Forging the Shield.

At this stage, you are learning more about the intricacies of combat, so
engaging other Shield members in discussions about combat will be quite
beneficial to you. You should be able to glean most of the information
you need to learn by interacting with your housemates and retain it by
recording the things you learn in your journal.

You will find that you are able to keep up on the goings on of the house
using: READLOG SHIELD
To see the previous serenade: READLOG SHIELD 1 1
This can extend for up to 6 serenades: READLOG SHIELD 1 6

HHELP VOLUNTEERADVICE can help with certain decisions such as how to
spend your lessons, which traits to learn, and which stats are important
to you.

You are not required to have a mentor, but it is a relationship that can
benefit you a great deal. For a list of mentors recommended by the
house, HHELP MENTORS

You can find out who is able to help in specific areas of the house
using HOUSE STRUCTURE.

   I am the shield against the sword.
Come one or come many, I stand ready to hold the pass.
   I am the cloak against the storm.
Take shelter in my presence, I am the Valley's walls.

   On the blood of my brothers, on the blood of my sisters,
I swear this oath, to carry you to victory, or lay beside you in defeat.
   To my comrades, to my countrymen,
According to my station, I serve you all without exception.

   With unrelenting purpose,
I bleed and spill blood on your behalf, that you may live in peace.
   In name of Cyrene and its Senate,
I will not fail in this.

   Ever loyal,
Beyond my dying breath.
