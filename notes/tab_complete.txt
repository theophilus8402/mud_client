* I think I need to have just one big completer function thing
    * that means I can't have different ones for each of the different aliases
    * I need to be able to handle em all
* text=""
    * don't give any options... that should help cut out some stuff
* text="a"
    * for now, don't worry about completing aliases
    * I store them as compiled regexes
    * so, I'd have to change things or start storing extra info to do this...
* text="t r"  # i.e. we have the alias, a space, and something we want to target
    * we can start super simple by just targetting anything in the room (in priority order)
        * enemies
        * mobs (not guards)
            * I can even choose by mobnum
        * players
* future work:
    * find the appropriate alias (should boil down to one)
    * the alias should have a way of identifying the target priorities
        * allies (i.e. fool should prioritize allies)
        * enemies (i.e. aeon should prioritize enemies)
    * see if there are area specific priorities
        * certain mobs over others?
            * orc child > orc soldier > knight
