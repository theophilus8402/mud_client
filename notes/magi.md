have triggers to help find shielded people
A nearly invisible magical shield forms around Ielana.
A dizzying beam of energy strikes you as your attack rebounds off of Ielana's

eq/balance triggers don't quite work when they are queued back to back
    the char.vitals doesn't update properly
spiffify tab completion
    be able to say which mobs can be attacked
    or set a blacklist?
    figure out a way to highlight stuff without the numbers
        maybe just strip the numbers when creating the highlights?
finish up that thing that populates the rat1234
    figure out why it's screwing up some of the mappings :( :(
there's something about falling asleep that screws up my queing system
    maybe I'm hiding some of the messages and I need to make sure it's

    and it was received well

hunting:
    creville

Lesson Plan:
             Artificing to Destroy

ssw freez
hail
scald
smashl
smasha
flux


diss
palp
reverb

================
staffstrike only uses balance, so I can combine it with golem things
targeting will be helpful with trying to mangle limbs
efreeti doesn't seem to affect being cold?
dehydrate and timeflux heal just over time
    maybe 30 - 45 seconds?
caloric -> freezing -> deepfrozen -> hypothermia -> pummel
oooh, I might be able to staffstrike and immediately shield
