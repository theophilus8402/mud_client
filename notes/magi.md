You suddenly perceive the vague outline of an aura of rebounding around Kog.

You call upon Whiirh to empower your staff and strike Kog, the power of air dispersing his aura of rebounding.
A crystalline golem would be unable to do any significant damage to an unfrozen target.

hypothermia is healed with restoration to torso, needs them to be frozen, golem can't freeze someone
staffstrike water gives level 1 freeze

Naoko is really good and Frances is learning to be a Magi

For how long does flux and scald last?
    I should make timers and highlight / warn me about them

Kog says in Cyrenese, "Prep legs and torso. Break left leg with air while wrenching arms, right leg with water while wrenching arms, cast deepfreeze, waterstrike torso and hypothermia."


make a counter for limb attacks :(

get gud at running (maybe an alias to run away)


You say, "Why break torso instead of something like head?"
You say, "Or arms."

Kog says to you in Cyrenese, "Hypothermia is cured by restoration to torso."

The affliction 'hypothermia' is cured by: Apply Restoration To Body.

Kog says in Cyrenese, "If you broke both of my legs, then broke my head, I could apply restoration to torso instead of the second leg, you'd land hypothermia and I'd immediately cure it and then get frozen off too."

staffstrike only uses balance, so I can combine it with golem things
targeting will be helpful with trying to mangle limbs
