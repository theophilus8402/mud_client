Like fortification, binding provides protection against losing your channels due
to others attacking them. If a channel that is unfortified is attacked, binding
will protect that channel a large percentage of the time. It has a willpower
loss associated with it, however.

for a single channel binding, multiplied by however many channels you have open.
