    be able to say which mobs can be attacked
    or set a blacklist?
    figure out a way to highlight stuff without the numbers
        maybe just strip the numbers when creating the highlights?
finish up that thing that populates the rat1234
    figure out why it's screwing up some of the mappings :( :(
better clotting
there's something about falling asleep that screws up my queing system
    maybe I'm hiding some of the messages and I need to make sure it's

Readying an insubstantial dagger, Grouulthuun begins to prowl towards Cassari.

Grouulthuun lowers his dagger, a frown of irritation evident upon his face.
Readying an insubstantial dagger, Grouulthuun begins to prowl towards you.

As an insubstantial dagger begins to pulse with a sinister glow, Grouulthuun
begins to close in on you.

Grouulthuun strikes out with incredible speed, the blade of an insubstantial
dagger hissing scant inches from your face. For a moment you feel nothing, then
a soul-rending agony pervades every fibre of your being, and your body collapses
bonelessly to the ground.
You have been afflicted with prone.
