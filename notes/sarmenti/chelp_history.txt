=========Mhaldor's History========

301 AF: What may well be one of the most memorable declarations of war
        in all of mortal history, the Infernal Guild declared war on
        their harboring city Ashtan, Bastion of the North. From out of
        the woodworks came shopkeepers, orphans, guards, and general
        citizenry who laid siege on the Infernal's beloved Iron Citadel
        laying ruin to all they had known. With the sky painted black
        came the end of a weak chapter and the beginnings of what would
        be a new power fused with Strength in Evil.
        [Events News 56-59]

        In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Infernal guild, Lord
        Sartan turned his wrath to Ashtan. Several scores of skeletal
        warriors, dragons and daemons are sent upon the Bastion of the
        North though they are repelled with some effort. Lady Valnurana
        is lured to Lord Sartan for His purposes but He is unable to
        carry out His tasks through Her completely.
        [Events 57]

        An alliance is formed between various Deities to interfere with
        the Lord's work. Lashing back at the Lord as a final retort,
        Lord Aegis and Lord Lupus lifted the island from the ground,
        dropping it onto Lord Sartan and entrapping Him beneath the
        ocean's depths.
        [Events 58 and 59]

        A stalagmite appears on the newly formed island. Loyalists to
        Lord Sartan impale themselves upon the stalagmite, eventually
        loosing the bonds of the LORD and causing a red fog to appear.
        This fog began to strangle the plantlife on the isle, rousing
        the anger of the Earthmother Gaia, who in her blind rage, shook
        the mountain imprisoning our LORD, thus freeing Him. By the will
        of Lord Sartan, the Malevolent five spires manifest upon the
        island as what we now know as the Baelgrim Fortress. The
        Fortress was a reward for those truly loyal to the LORD. On this
        day the Maldaathi Knights were born with Lord Kaelin deemed the
        first High Lord Maleficence.

        bridge some sort of working relationship with forestals.

        externally imposed hardships.

310 AF: Strange new plantlife begins to appear on the island, seemingly
        having a life of its own. They come to be known as lycopods and
        are affected by the red fog.

311 AF: An important post is made regarding Slavery and those who serve
        in this capacity in Mhaldor. No citizen shall have gone without

        kidnapped the following month and swiftly rescued. The walls and
        ground of Moghedu are stained red as they are slain numerous
        times over.

313 AF: Mhaldor attained a full working city status complete with guards
        and abilities to function as any major city. Truly a day marked
        in Strength that would change history as we knew it.

        The center point of Mhaldor receives its name, Stygian
        Crossroads.

        Lord Hwolf is the first mortal deemed worthy to hold the title
        of Tyrannus.

        Manitou plants the seed of an oak within Mhaldor, it is
        blackened and transformed. Hwolf carves the Mhaldorian Oath on
        the tree to be used when inducting new citizens to the ways of
        Evil.

        the cause.

317 AF: Gack moves from the Circle of Pain to the newest addition in
        Mhaldor, the Slave Market.

318 AF: Lord Sartan's wrath is wrought upon a weakened city for their
        failed attempts at landmarking. One of His demons is unleashed
        upon the city to devour the weak, or for the weak to find
        strength to return the demon's essence to its Maker.

        Citizens begin having disturbing visions in the midst of their
        every day lives. Evil has found a way to taint Good. Rumours of
        a new guild are heard in sibilant whispers. Later that year the
        Apostate Guild is founded with Xerimor as its first Messiah.

319 AF: Sarapin sacrifices are reinstated.

        Lord Sartan disallows the right to an Arena for punishment in
        return for weakness. The weak are not graced with gifts until
        those gifts are earned.

        Tizzee is gifted with the Tormentor's Lash, a whip crafted by
        the Lord Himself in reward for her loyalty and servitude above
        and beyond the ordinary.

        Hashan is allied with Mhaldor for the purpose of strengthening
        landmarking attempts.

        Lord Phaestus breaches Mhaldor's walls, slaying many guards so
        as to pave a way for His Order to attack. Apparently they could
        not do it themselves within Divine intervention.

320 AF: Mhaldor gains six landmarks. Strength overcame weakness this
        crossing.

        By Lord Sartan's decree, the Sarapin Sacrifice will be carried
        out every tenth year.

        beginning a new state in the City of Evil.

        Mhaldor receives her hard earned Arena after five years of
        working toward it. Statues are erected to honour the five
        largest contributors of the arena; Hwolf, Kaelin, Orchist,
        Silvaria and Mistral. Yig is granted one for his exquisite
        detail work.

        Lady Eris. This is done in response to Lord Sartan loosing
        hordes of lycopods in Lord Aegis' temple.

        Hwolf demands every shrine to the Lord of War be destroyed in
        retaliation for such blatant disrespect of The Malevolent One's
        temple.

326 AF: Indrani, the Demon Queen is released from Her prison. Lord
        Sartan instructs Mhaldor to treat Her with respect as Sin is
        introduced to the city proper.

        Lady Indrani informs Mhaldor that Her Order is now open to
        dedicated followers.

        With the last bits of work complete, the temple of the Demon
        Queen is opened within the desert.

327 AF: An avid Aegean, Sunrise Darrion, is entrapped in the altar. The
        Lord sees fit to have this mortal taught of the Truths and of
        Evil. Many citizens preach to him while he is enslaved.
        Eventually he comes to accept the ways of Evil and joins
        Mhaldor. Truth always prevails.

        of the flesh being entirely acceptable; to want is mortal.
        [Mhaldor News 644]

        During an exciting summoning ritual we were able to summon the
