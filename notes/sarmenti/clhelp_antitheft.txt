This scroll covers the basics of how theft works from the viewpoint of
the victim, empowering you to prevent heathens from taking advantage of
you.

Theft, fundamentally, is another person getting your gold or another
object from your inventory without your permission. Several classes are
able to do this in various ways. Any theft attempt on a novice (below
level 30) is illegal and should be reported to your superiors.

PICKPOCKETING (Serpent)
=================================================================
The ability to pickpocket is a Subterfuge skill available only to the
Serpent class, and is one of the most common forms of theft.

A Serpent can choose either to pickpocket something random or something
specific from you.

Untargeted Pickpocket
----------------------
If you do not have the Selfishness defense active, a successful
untargetted pickpocket attempt will always succeed in stealing one of
the following from your inventory:

- Letter
- Gold
- Sigil
- Key
- Shard

Groupable items can be stolen in groups, i.e. a group of three monolith
sigils. The amount of gold stolen per pickpocket attempt depends on the
amount you are carrying in your inventory: the larger the sum, the more
will be stolen.

If there is nothing worth stealing, then the pickpocket attempt fails.
However, thieves can continue attempting to pick your pockets as long as
the pickpocketing is not targeted.

Targeted Pickpocket
-------------------
It is much harder to steal a particular item, and the chance of success
is virtually nil unless the thief has spent time Casing your inventory.
This is another Subterfuge ability that increases the chances of a
successful targeted pickpocket.

There is no limit on the type of item that can be stolen through a
targeted pickpocket. However, if the attempt fails, no other thief can
attempt a targeted pickpocket on you for an Achaean day.

The Casing Process
-------------------
A Serpent can only Case you roughly once a day, and their chances of
Casing success improve if they have Mesmerised you first. Each
successful Case improves their chances of stealing their intended item
from you.

If you have the Vigilance defense (from Vision), you will be able to
detect a Casing attempt much earlier.

First Case: You will see nothing if you do not use Vigilance.
If you do, then you will see a shadowy figure circling you, taking
inventory of your possessions.

Second Case: Without Vigilance, you will see a shadowy figure circling
you, taking inventory of your possessions.
With Vigilance, you will be able to discern the thief's identity.

Third Case: You will see the attempt and the thief's identity with or
without Vigilance.

While there is no way to prevent being Cased, you can destroy all their
accumulated casing knowledge on you by slaying them yourself or hiring a
Mark to slay them on your behalf.

A Casing attempt is reason enough to initiate aggressive activity on
them, though the young are encouraged to hire Marks instead (HELP MARK).

Most importantly, however, you must be able to defeat the actual
pickpocket attempt.

The Pickpocketing Process
-------------------------
An actual pickpocket attempt, regardless of targeted or untargeted, is
generally the same.

The thief will HYPNOTISE you, then implant SUGGESTions for you to
perform actions such as take items or gold out of your containers and
relax your selfishness defense. They will then SEAL the suggestions and
snap their fingers in front of you to activate them.

Once you go through the motions (or perhaps even as you perform them),
the thief will physically attempt to pick your pockets.

The best defense now is to LOSE the thief (they will usually be
shadowing you) and leave the area quickly, or immediately be selfish. A
successful pickpocketing requires the thief to be immobile, as any
movement will disrupt it.

If a soft tug upon your apparel grabs at your attention, and you realise
in an instant that your inventory is lighter, then you have been
successfully pickpocketed.

If you have the Vigilance defense, you will be able to spin around
quickly, just in time to notice who the thief slinking away is.

Counter Measures
-----------------
First: Always have the Selfishness defense up. This is vital as it
completely prevents untargetted pickpocket attempts, forcing a thief to
hypnotise you to be generous before they can even start pickpocketing.

Second: Hone reflexes such as immediately returning gold to your pack
when you take it out, and rewearing any items that you are forced to
remove.

[Note]: Ensure you specifically return 'sovereigns' instead of gold, as
thieves have been known to secretly slip people nuggets of gold and
steal your coins while you put the nugget in your pack instead.

Third: Ink and activate a Bell tattoo. This tattoo will alert you to any
attempts to appraise your inventory, which is how a thief knows what
items you have and what to steal.

[Note]: This tattoo can be countered by using the Mesmerise ability. If
Mesmerised, the warning this tattoo provides is delayed well beyond the
successful appraisal.

Fourth: Keep a shimmering orb in your inventory. This enchanted orb
disrupts appraisal attempts by preventing the thief from discerning what
your inventory holds, making item theft much more difficult.

Fifth: Once learned, use the Vigilance defense. This ability enables you
to detect the identity of a thief casing or stealing from you, as well
as slightly increases your defense against hypnosis.

Retribution
------------
If you notice a successful casing or pickpocket attempt, you should
immediately LOSE the thief and depart the area. You can seek retribution
by:

1. Slaying the thief.
2. Hiring a Mark on the thief.

To retrieve your stolen goods, you must bid on them via a silent auction
via a fence. See HELP FENCE.

THEFT BY OTHER CLASSES
=================================================================
Other classes generally do not have the ability to steal from you,
besides force abilities that can force you to perform certain actions.
However, even this is very limited in scope theft-wise and is largely
combat-related, which will be covered elsewhere.

Other forms of theft include prisming or portalling to you while you are
in a house or stockroom and picking up anything valuable on the ground.
To counter this, drop a monolith sigil (for portals) and move out of the
room (for prisms).

See also HELP THEFT for more information.

SUMMARY
=================================================================
For all types of theft, it is important to:

1. Be aware of your surroundings
2. Keep selfishness up
3. Store valuable items in containers
4. Learn reflexive protections.

Being stolen from is merely an example of your failure to adequately
prepare. Do not fail.

ANTI-THEFT EXAMINATION
==================================================================
Once you are prepared and have made the proper reflexes, you will need
to find a Serpent to conduct an anti-theft examination on
you.
