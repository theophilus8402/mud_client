<> SENTRIES <>
==============
Well done. You have laboured hard and reached the rank of Sentry;
however your work is not yet done. You have only just begun to refine
your skills. With hard work, you too will stand amongst the ranks of the
Initiated.

Understanding Your Next Steps
------------------------------
As a Sentry, you will begin to work on the basics of both solo and group
combat, developing your skills and putting them into practice.

You will finish a set of required tasks, which will see you learning the
basics of combat, and will ensure that you have a sufficient
understanding of them to move onwards in the house. Each of these tasks
has a level, which stands for that requirement's tier. These will matter
for your next rank.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them over the house
channel, or ask any Instructor aide or house leader personally. Remember
that HOUSE STRUCTURE will list all officers and their aides, should you
ever need help. If you have questions about a specific class, HHELP
MENTORS is the best place to check. Anyone listed under a class will be
able to help teach you about it, or any Strategos aides should have
knowledge of many of them.

(NOTE: this scroll is the full Sentry task scroll, with explanations for
each task. It is rather long, as a result. If you already know the
details and just want something to reference back to, HHELP
SENTRYREFERENCE contains a much shorter version)

Requirements (individual explanations below)
------------
Required tasks:

-Join the army

-Vanguard 1

-Phalanx  1

--Sentry Evaluation--

--------------------------------
Required Tasks:
--------------------------------

========== Join the Army ===========
As a Sentry, you will need to enlist in the Cyrenian Army, and will be
expected to serve in defense of the city when she is attacked. You will
need to speak with either the Minister of War or an Aide to the Minister
of War to enlist. Remember that the aides that are currently about can
be checked with AIDES WAR.

 ==== The Imperial Vanguard ====

The Imperial Vanguard is the Shield's solo combat program, and will
track and reward your efforts in one against one combat. As a Sentry,
you will be expected to join the Vanguard, and to advance to at least
the first rank within it.

-Joining the Vanguard:
-------------------
To enter into the ranks of the Imperial Vanguard, you will need to to be
briefed. The briefing can be conducted by any aide to the Shield
Instructor or Shield Strategos, which you can check on with HOUSE
STRUCTURE. For your briefing, the aide will discuss, instruct,
demonstrate, or otherwise satisfy them that you have a solid grasp on at
least one method to finish a fight. If you don't have one, don't leave.
Ask questions until you understand. If the aide is not comfortable
enough with your class, they may recruit help.

-Vanguard 1
----------
Next, you will need to reach the rank of Provocator within the Vanguard
itself. The full details can be found in HHELP VANGUARD, but
essentially, you will have to have several spars or duels, which will
earn points within the vanguard program. To earn points, fights must be
noted on deathsight by anyone listed in HHELP STRUCTURE (just ask over
the house channel when you need something charged). When you've reached
the rank of Provocator, you'll have completed this task.

==== The Imperial Phalanx =====

The Imperial Phalanx is the Shield's group combat program, that will
track and reward your efforts in group fighting situations, from group
spars to raids. As a Sentry, you will be expected to join the Phalanx,
and earn at least the first rank in it.

-Joining the Phalanx:
-------------------
To enter into the ranks of the Imperial Phalanx, you will need to
undergo a briefing. This briefing can be conducted by any aide to the
Shield instructor or Shield Decurion, which you can check with HOUSE
STRUCTURE. For your briefing, the aide will go over the basics of how to
participate and contribute to a group fight, and possibly ask you to
demonstrate in a group spar. This briefing will only go over the basics
of group combat, so you should require little to no prior knowledge.

Phalanx 1
---------
Next, you will need to reach the rank of Spearman within the Phalanx.
The full details can be found within HHELP PHALANX, but essentially you
will have to participate in a few group spars, king of the hill arena
events, or live raids, which will all earn points within the vanguard
program. To earn points, fights must be noted by anyone listed in HHELP
STRUCTURE (just ask over the house channel when you need something
charged). When you've reached the rank of Spearman, you'll have
completed this task.

============ Evaluation ===========
When you have completed the required sections, seek out the Strategos or
a Strategos aide for an evaluation of your progress. You will engage in
at least two full speed spars with the officer or aide, after which they
will talk you through how you did and what you have to work on. You are
not required to win these fights, but you should use them as a chance to
show what you've learned, and listen carefully to what you can improve
on.

Once you have completed these fights, speak to the Instructor or an Aide
for review. You will be titled as a Silver Sentry, and can refer to
HHELP SILVER for your next steps.
