* need to figure out how to handle marking the fact that I can't
    enter a certain room from a certain direction
    * example: can't go from 1 (e) -> (w) 2 because of a locked door
    * I might need to mark it on the room I'm trying to leave
    * maybe have a field: movement_issues
        * [("e", "locked_door"), ("s", "slow"), ("d", "swim")]
            * some of these can indicate certain actions to take
                as well:
                * swim -> swim
                * underwater -> eat pear; swim
                * unlock -> unlock dir;open dir;dir
                * occultist_house_hall -> kneel;wait 10;enter gate
            * other words indicate increased movement cost
                * slow
            * other words indicate that we can't enter the room
                that way:
                * locked_door
* I want to figure out a way to record the path I take
    * I might enter a dir incorrectly
        * notice the dir is wrong automagically
            * triggers aren't easy, but... doable in an ideal
                scenario
                * Running queued eqbal command: N
                * Running queued eqbal command: U
                  Room.WrongDir "u"
                  There is no exit in that direction.
                * Running queued eqbal command: D\r\nThere is a door in the way, to the down.
                * Running queued eqbal command: UNLOCK DOOR D\r\nYou are not carrying a key for this door.
        * manually edit it
