Pani drops to the floor and sweeps her legs round at you.
Pani knocks your legs out from under you and sends you sprawling to the floor.
Pani expertly jabs her fingers into the nerve cluster behind one of your ears.
Pani balls up one fist and hammerfists you.
She connects to the left leg!
Pani eases herself out of the Scorpion stance.
A look of total calm comes over Pani as she comes to land in a menacing stance.
You feel irresistibly compelled to apply restoration to arms.
You take out some salve and quickly rub it on your arms.

Leofrik says in a deep, cultured voice, "Anti-Psion strats? You mean spam
shield, run a lot, slow prep us, cure the unweaves quick?"
Namino says, "Only need the shield on ravage, really."
Namino says, "That's enough to stop almost all psions."
Namino says, "Paralysis if prone, impatience if standing, shield on headbreak if
you're cautious, or on ravage if you're reckless."


You feel a sudden jerk, and the air immediately surrounding you comes alight
with pale, etheric fire as a strange hissing noise fills the air.
# ether displace

You feel a strong tug in the pit of your stomach. Your surroundings dissolve
into the featureless swirl of the ether, resolving once more into a recognisable
landscape as you land before Farrah.

get better at throwing daggers into other rooms


You strap a concussion bomb to the suicide mouse's back.

You have recovered balance on all limbs.

You are far too selfish to throw anything away like that.

A feeling of generosity spreads throughout you.

You have recovered equilibrium.

You drop a suicide mouse.

You have recovered balance on all limbs.

You order a suicide mouse to kill Crixos.
A suicide mouse does not see who you want killed.

You give a mental salute as you hear the faint sound of your suicide mouse fulfilling its mission.

Ellryn stops you from moving that way.
