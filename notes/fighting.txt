Lorei says in Cyrenese, "So a possible killpath as a Magi is to prep a leg, prep
the torso, break the leg, freeze while breaking torso and then pummel."


Lorei says in Cyrenese, "You could try it on me!"
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "Try freezing me."
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "I remember it used to."
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "Not sure now."
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "I don't really bother with efreeti most days."
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "I'm frozen and ablaze."
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "Ahh."
You say, "Interesting."
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "Now try the efreeti first."
You say, "So, do you normally go the freezing and pummel route?"
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "Umm."
You say, "And then try freezing you?"
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "I'm a bit weird."
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "I use ret sleeplocks into the freezing route."
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "The ice put the fire out."
You say, "Ret sleeplocks?"
You say, "Oh? interesting!"
Lorei says to you in Cyrenese, "The retardation vibration."
Kaden says in a quiet voice, "Retardation vibe to enable me to put them to sleep."


Lorei says in Cyrenese, "I have the feeling it may just be haemophilia."
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "Bloodboil is an example of a class active cure."
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "Depthswalkers like me have um, accelerate."
A look of relief comes over Lorei as she grows less pale.
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "In my case, it's stopped by recklessness."
Edotlina says with a brogue accent, "Alleviate here." (blademaster?)
Edotlina says with a brogue accent, "But paralysis stops it."
Edotlina says with a brogue accent, "For Water..."
Edotlina says with a brogue accent, "Purify, but not sure what stops it."
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "Blademasters have another way out of locks, too."
Edotlina says to Lorei with a brogue accent, "Phoenix?"

Kog says in Cyrenese, "Ama-maalier, when drawn, gives ten seconds of movement
immunity. Enough time for a Dragon to breathrain twice, after drawing it. So if
at first you don't succeed, run like hell."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Lorei raises her hand in the air.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog nods his head at Lorei.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Lorei says in Cyrenese, "What does movement mean exactly?"
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Ama-maalier fixes you precisely at that point, at that
elevation."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Comprehension flashes across Lorei's face.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "You cannot fly, you cannot land, you cannot be moved. You
exist there, and only there."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Lorei nods her head emphatically.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Alright. We will end with the most complicated, then."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Unique to Hashani Alchemists is a skill called
'Radiation'"

Sphera takes a drink from an elegant diamond vial.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "It draws from their Wellspring of power, and unleashes
the raw energy on all around. It requires a great deal of focus, and has several
unique constraints- however, it is extremely potent."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Radiation will strike anyone in the room, at any
elevation, three times. Each strike will do more damage than the last, and the
third strike will be so powerful that everyone in the entire area will be
blinded beyond what a mindseye can help with, for several seconds."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "From...testing, it is a channel, but it is almost
impossible to interrupt."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Two-Handers can distract, and forcing them to act will
negate the rest. But, otherwise? Run- they will not care if you hinder them
otherwise, and racing to kill the Alchemist typically results in the defenders
losing."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Sphera takes a drink from an elegant diamond vial.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "The unique constraints, too, are important. An Alchemist
can only channel those energies once every two minutes. Just attempting it - not
completing it - begins this restriction."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Second, each ROOM can only sustain such an act every
five."
Kog says in Cyrenese, "This means that if Mezghar starts Radiation here, then
decides against it, he cannot do so again for two minutes. And this room is safe
from further Radiation- from ANY Alchemist- for five."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-

A nearly invisible magical shield forms around Calahan.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Once started, the Alchemist cannot take any other
actions."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "It will start as such."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
The temperature of the air abruptly begins to rise, a strange glittering haze
filling the air in the distance.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "That sensation is your warning. There are no second
warnings, the damage begins soon after. Each stage has a unique appearance, and
does more than the last."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Your skin begins to burn, a rippling fire that courses beyond the surface and
quests deep within.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "This stage strikes me for about a quarter of my health.
Dangerous, but not typically lethal- however, the next two stages come swiftly
after."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Sphera takes a drink from an elegant diamond vial.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Your body feels as though it is catching aflame from within, your skin bubbling
and flaking away even as the haze that descends upon the location becomes almost
opaque.
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
Kog says in Cyrenese, "The last time that struck me, it did about sixty percent
of my maximum health."
4050h, 5346m, 15400e, 19900w exdb-
The world turns white, a raging force beyond the bounds of mortal control
unleashed in a cataclysm of destruction.
