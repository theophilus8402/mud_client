Trial of the Timekeeper

Overview:

We expect the Collegium's basic requirements - these being Trial of the
Scimitar, Trial of the Scribe, Trial of the Strategist, and Trial of
Camaraderie - to be completed within ninety (90) months of starting the
trials.

It is mandatory to acknowledge this stipulation, and optionally,
you may present a letter with a short plan on when you expect to
complete each requirement.

Tasks:

You must begin Timekeeper within one year of joining the Collegium.

Begin by reviewing CLANHELP REQUIREMENTS again and each of the Trials of
War to ensure you understand the application of knowledge that must be
demonstrated and the time frame for doing so.

Before begining Timekeeper you must first secure an Aegean mentor. It is
encouraged that you seek out someone who is available to guide you and
will effectively contribute to your growth in the Collegium.

Once this is done, send a message to Condicar Truax and the Domnitor of
Warfare, stating you are ready to start the Trials. The official start
will be the date on which you send this message.

Assessment:

Occasionally circumstances beyond your control may slow down your
progress and an extension might be needed. If you feel you need more
time for some reason, please contact a Drillmaster and explain to them
what's going on and they may grant you an extension.

You will only fail this trial if you take longer than the required 90
months to fill your duties. You will not fail if you miss a date set in
a letter you send; we expect that you will understand that you will need
to put more resources into passing your trials, if this is the case.

Assessors: Domnitor Morthif, Condicar Truax, Warlord Caelan, and
Master-at-Arms Austere.
