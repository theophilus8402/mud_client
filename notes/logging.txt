things to log:
* regular text from server
* gmcp data from server
* user input
* data sent to server?

it will need to be streaming log... so I can't really do json

each entry:
* type
    * server_text
    * gmcp_data
    * user_input
    * data_sent
* time of entry
* msg

example:
2016-11-26 21:33:23.23243 //\\ "server_text //\\ something bad happened!!"
