have triggers to help find shielded people
eq/balance triggers don't quite work when they are queued back to back
    the char.vitals doesn't update properly
spiffify tab completion
    be able to say which mobs can be attacked
    or set a blacklist?
    figure out a way to highlight stuff without the numbers
        maybe just strip the numbers when creating the highlights?
finish up that thing that populates the rat1234
    figure out why it's screwing up some of the mappings :( :(
there's something about falling asleep that screws up my queing system
    maybe I'm hiding some of the messages and I need to make sure it's
    all in that current chunk before assuming that I sent the message
    and it was received well
start documenting all items/mobs in the db and where we found them
    shrines
    mobs
    mobs will move around a lot and get different numbers
        so, need to have some kind of limiter...
        like no more than five of the same long name registered in a room?
    this will help me find:
        shrines
        certain mobs
        discern patterns in mob movement
        quest items
        guard placements
        monoliths
        sewers

to get to nur:
    get to yggdrasil, u, u, fly around a lot... "on a bridge of bark" push rift

The ominously haunting sound of Elon suddenly fills your head, threatening to drown out all other sound.
Kyrista begins to tumble towards the northwest.
Rozette begins to tumble towards the northwest.
Thaisen begins to tumble towards the northwest.
Kione begins to tumble towards the northwest.
Leofrik begins to tumble towards the northwest.
You obey.
You begin to tumble agilely to the northwest.


get limb counting working and in the logs
get affs in the fighting log
make an alias to put down the next prioritized vibe
ask Naoko about a post (grouul mentioned it)

flesh out the fighting log:
    moving
    people not there

# nice way of putting up and down auto defences

Naoko is really good and Frances is learning to be a Magi

# for how long does flux and scald last?
    I should make timers and highlight / warn me about them

# kill path:
Kog says in Cyrenese, "Prep legs and torso. Break left leg with air while wrenching arms, right leg with water while wrenching arms, cast deepfreeze, waterstrike torso and hypothermia."

You say, "Why break torso instead of something like head?"
You say, "Or arms."
Kog says to you in Cyrenese, "Hypothermia is cured by restoration to torso."

The affliction 'hypothermia' is cured by: Apply Restoration To Body.

Kog says in Cyrenese, "If you broke both of my legs, then broke my head, I could apply restoration to torso instead of the second leg, you'd land hypothermia and I'd immediately cure it and then get frozen off too."

hypothermia is healed with restoration to torso, needs them to be frozen, golem can't freeze someone
staffstrike water gives level 1 freeze


# make a counter for limb attacks :(




# get gud at running (maybe an alias to run away)
# aliases/things to better do auto defs (notes/defences.txt)
# make a way of doing target priority
# get some concussion bombs?  But it might be more helpful to use it with alertness
# make a warning/escape from alchemist displace (notes/alchemist.txt)
# see if impatience is up on the priority list (need it for bards)
# show in the party log people (allies/enemies) coming and going

================
= fighting
================
staffstrike only uses balance, so I can combine it with golem things
targeting will be helpful with trying to mangle limbs
efreeti doesn't seem to affect being cold?
dehydrate and timeflux heal just over time
    maybe 30 - 45 seconds?
caloric -> freezing -> deepfrozen -> hypothermia -> pummel
oooh, I might be able to staffstrike and immediately shield
