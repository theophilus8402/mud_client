== HHELP WELCOME ==
===================
Welcome to the Vashnarian Shield, Volunteer.

We of the Shield have a great deal of respect for your decision to
devote your life to the defence of Cyrene, and will eagerly greet you as
your brothers and sisters in arms as soon as you are ready to begin.

We understand that things can be confusing when you are new to
adventuring, and so if you ever have any questions, or aren't sure what
you should be doing, just ask! You can speak over our novice channel
using HNT, or you can ask any questions you have to our instructor
aides, who are listed in our HOUSE STRUCTURE.

In order to reach your next rank, you will need to become oriented with
the ways of the Shield with our estate, the Silver Citidel.

For your first task, you will familiarise yourself with the Shield's
ways. You can use HHELP to browse the scrolls that will help to do this,
HHELP PRIMER being the most important. You aren't expected to memorize
anything, but think about what you've read, and be prepared to discuss
your thoughts on it.

Next, you will explore our estate and home, the Silver Citidel.

To do this task, look at HHELP ESTATEGUIDE, which will help show you
around the house, and teach you about the places within it. You will
only be required to visit and read about a few of the most important
spots, though you are of course encouraged to explore the entire place.

The following rooms are required, meaning that you need to find and read
about them in the estateguide scroll:

-The Hall of Shields

-Briefing Hall

-Proving grounds of the Vashnarian Shield

-The Crimson Arsenal

-The Old Stone Bar

When you've finished exploring the estate, you will need to pick one
room or feature that you found interesting or had questions about. You
will then need to find an Instructor's aide (you can see the full list
with HOUSE STRUCTURE, or simply ask if one is available over HNT), lead
them to that spot, and have a short conversation on it, as well as on
your understanding of our Primer. Afterwards, you will be taken off
probation and promoted to rank two.

After your promotion, your next steps for advancement can be found in
HHELP VOLUNTEER. There's no rush or time limit for advancing, but we
encourage our members to advance as quickly as they feel they are ready
to.

Until the next watch, Volunteer.

== HHELP PRIMER ==
==================
<> The Shield Primer <>
=======================

As a Shield,
Keep sacred our tradition,
Let nothing come before your duty.

As a Shield,
Speak no ill of brother or sister,
Hard words drive wedges between allies.

As a Shield,
Be the sword, be the spear,
Heed well the hand that guides you.

As a Shield,
A dull or rusted blade
Brings only shame on the battle plain.

As a Shield,
To aid the enemy
One need only miss the battle.

As a Shield,
Take pride in fighting hard,
But there is only glory in victory.


<> The Volunteer's Mores <>
===========================

Loyalty
--------
The Shield is nothing if not loyal. Defense of the Cyrenian Valley is
our sole purpose, and we shall not fail in it. We are loyal to Cyrene
and her Senate above all, and also to each other, allowing no petty
difference or circumstance come between us or before our duty. As in the
phalanx, we raise our shields not only to defend ourselves, but those
behind us, and those next to us.

Readiness
----------
The Shield is nothing if not ready. All our loyalty is for naught if we
are not prepared for the battlefield. We must keep our weapons sharp and
our armour strong, our vials ready and our rifts stocked. We must train
our skills and hone our reflexes, study our foes and know our allies. We
must accept every defeat--and even our victories--asking "How might I
improve?" To fail in any of these is to fail the citizens and our
brethren when they need us most.

Sacrifice
----------
The Shield is nothing if not willing. All our training is for naught if
we do not give our all. We do not fear death, we fear the death of our
charges because we were not there to protect them, we fear the death of
our brethren because we were not there to aid them. We hold the line, we
give no inch, we charge as one, for when one Shield tastes victory, all
who sacrificed to make it possible share in it.

Hold firm upon the field. Hold high the Republic. Remember these,
Volunteer, and you will do well.
