(Sentries): You say, "So... how does one fight or not get dead against an alchemist?"
(Sentries): Naoko says, "Manually cure tempers."
(Sentries): You say, "Why manually cure them?"
(Sentries): Naoko says, "Because if you don't you die."
(Sentries): Naoko says, "If you cure tempers while actively being afflicted, you spend three quarters of the fight paralyzed completely. Let 'em build, shield, and CURING PRIOAFF TEMPERED<humour>."
(Sentries): Naoko says, "Fighting an alchemist is a game of chicken. You have to play with their precision."
(Sentries): You say, "Interesting."
(Sentries): You say, "They can build up a lot of bleeding real quick."
(Sentries): Naoko says, "Nah, just don't let them inundate."
(Sentries): You say, "Oh, so they have different humours?"
(Sentries): You say, "What do they have to do to inundate?"
(Sentries): Naoko says, "Inundate consumes humour tempers. Choleric for 9% of max health per temper, melancholic for the same thing but mana, sanguine for 6% of max health as bleed, and phlegmatic for lethargy at 2, lethargy and anorexia at 4, lethargy and anorexia and slickness at 6, and 8 adds weariness."
(Sentries): You say, "Thanks for the info!"
(Sentries): Naoko says, "Mind you, 8 is the max. 8 choleric plus sensitivity plus educe iron all in one combo, which yes they can do, is 112% of your max health. Yes, that's more than all of it. Yes this kills you in one hit."

(Sentries): Naoko says, "Homunculus corruption wore off."
(Sentries): Naoko says, "And yes, you can clot yourself to death. Mind you, if you're below 60% in both mana and health at once, they can instantly kill you."

(Sentries): Naoko says, "60%."
(Sentries): Naoko says, "However, it cannot stop you from flying."
