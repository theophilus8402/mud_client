* with them being immutable,
    * we can track changes for everything
* make sure a variable set can't be changed to a different type later
    i.e. s.x = 3  ...  s.x = (1, 2, 3) is an error
    * this will help with tracking changes and make sure we don't do silly things
* keep track of changes
    s._changes
    s2 - s1 will show the difference between the two states
