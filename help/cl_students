Welcome! Today begins your journey to being a useful addition to
this city's defense! As part of your contribution to the city and in
exchange for all that the Seat of Chaos has to offer you, you are
expected to learn and demonstrate the following before enlisting as a
soldier and to satisfy graduation requirements.

==================================================================

Part 1- Raid Dominion

==================================================================

The Basics:

How a raid works, what happens during a raid-

Essentially to begin a raid, a city must kill 5-6 citizens within
another city. Once this happens, a raid is sanctioned.

Once the raid is sanctioned, soldiers of the city being attacked will
not lose experience for dying. However, if the attacking city plants an
armed tank (See Help City Destruction for specifics), each death of a
soldier builds the tank, preparing it to destroy the room in which it is
located. This can temprorarily close a shop, bank, post office, or other
important room. For this reason, city raids are important both to take
part in, and to prevent. It is worth noting that the deaths may prepare
the tank in increments from levels 1-3 with one destroying one room, and
a level 3 destroying many. Level ones are by far the most common.

Now that you understand the why, go over the how with a professor, the
Warlord, or one of his aides to learn and perfect the following:

Basic Targetting
----------------
Learn how to listen and to follow a leader's target calls.


Call for Help
-------------
Whenever you are in danger and cannot get citizens in time, CALL FOR
HELP will summon guards, if they are within range, to save you.

Blocking reflexes
-----------------
Your leader will sometimes call for you to block a certain direction. If
you are able to, learn how to reflexively block, and reflexively unblock
when your party leader calls for it. Also set up a party announce for
your blocking.

Basic Class Defense Abilities
-----------------------------
Contact someone of your class and learn how your class can be used to
defend the city and what its specialties are as far as raid defense or
attack.

==================================================================

Part 2- Combat Ascension

==================================================================


Bombs and bomb calling
----------------------
Learn the different types of bombs and their purpose.
Learn how to set up reflexes to alert your party when you've thrown a
bomb and what direction.



Line of Site Strategies involving different classes
--------------------------------------------
Learn how the Aeon Strategy works and how you can help with it.
Learn how the Lust Strategy works.
Learn what a star stack or normal line of sight strategy involves.
Learn what snipe strategies are.
Learn what Breathstream does and how it helps.



Suicide Strategies
-------------------
Learn what a basic group suicide or "Bomb" strategy involves

Rush strategies
-------------------
Learn how a rush works and some of the good ways to effectuate them such
as:
   Following
   Summoning
   Empressing


Help with all of the above mentioned reflexes can be found by asking to
join the Voidborn Insanity clan, a clan allowing insane discussion.


Again, when you are ready to demonstrate all of these things, step
forward to the Warlord, a professor, or an Aide to the Warlord for
testing!

Note: Please do not ask for testing unless you are prepared to
demonstrate and explain the tasks. The interview for this rank should
not take more than 15 minutes to complete. If it becomes clear that you
are not ready, the test will end, and you will need to properly prepare
and try again at a later time.
