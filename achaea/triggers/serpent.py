for serpents, watch out for darkshade:
Nephiny says in Cyrenese in a boyish, purring voice, "So, what you need to do against serpents.."
Nephiny says in Cyrenese in a boyish, purring voice, "Switch the darkshade priority to the highest priority when you're at four ticks, or so."
Nephiny says in Cyrenese in a boyish, purring voice, "Then switch it back."
Nephiny says in Cyrenese in a boyish, purring voice, "Then you only have to worry about the lock."

The sun has rendered you too weak to move a muscle.

Sunlight shines down upon you mercilessly, rippling across your skin like fire.
