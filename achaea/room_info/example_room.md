            "desc": "A large, mirrored glass display window frames the Merchant\'s Quarter, \\"Deli of Disaster\\" drawn upon it in elegant, ebony script. Orange paint has been swirled over the walls in a spiral design, gold leaf pressed into the brush strokes to create a fiery appearance. Rich mahogany planks have been placed on the lower half of the wall, dividing it into two distinct sec'
tions. Four blackened steel racks, their sides stylised into a phoenix in different stages of flight, line the eastern wall. On the opposite wall, a display case rests, its blue glass remarkably free of dirt or fingerprints allowing customers to view the treasures placed within. The back wall is dominated by a varnished, serpentine mahogany counter, its wood expertly carved to resemble flames that lick around the rounded edges. Behind the counter, lies a door with mahogany moulding, which seems the only way to stock the display case. A brocade, forest green curtain covers the door\'s entrance, its folds fluttering with the breeze of the front door opening or closing. A small mahogany table and a few chairs have been squeezed in an empty corner, marking the shop as an oft-used meeting place.",

The surrounding torchlight glints off the reflective stone creating a bright aura about the chamber, every nook and cranny cleaned meticulously so that no dust begins to gather. A pair of immense golden doors lead out of the chamber to east, elaborate engravings covering every inch of the opulent metal. Lavish linens spread across wide chairs situated along the outside walls, reserved for emissaries waiting to meet with the Lord of Warfare in His chambers. Servants dash quickly across the vast dome and into other areas of the keep, a few lone acolytes shouting orders to the passing peasants and pointing them to their next assignments.",
